# VEdition Documentation

![banner](img/banner.jpg)

Welcome to the _VEdition_ technical documentation. Currently, these pages are practically limited to internal use, and provide the theorical foundation of the model and some instructions about using its software.

As soon as they get more stable state, the corresponding software repositories are be published at the [VeDPH GitHub](https://github.com/vedph/).

>As repository and code names require a short name, the internal implementation codename for this edition model and its software is GVE; so you will often find this acronym when reading about software.
