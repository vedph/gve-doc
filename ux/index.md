# User Experience

This section of the documentation refers to the frontend GUI designed and implemented to provide a user-friendly, collaborative and web-based content creation system for data shaped according to our [model](../model/index).

In general, given the complexity of a genetic model, I tried to imagine an easy UX which mostly mimicks the traditional process of a scholar in editing an autograph text.

When faced with an annotated text like this, the first approach is right trying to make a sense of it: we start from the text, and then explore all the annotations stemming from it, as represented by a combination of visual hints and additional portions of text. In most cases, such annotations represent changes of the start text, in terms of editing operations: the author (or anyone else acting on the text) deletes something, or adds something, or moves something around. This process accumulates many changes on the text, until it reaches the end of the transformation chain.
